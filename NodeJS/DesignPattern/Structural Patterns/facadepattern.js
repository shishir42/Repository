//Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.
//Façade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

//The Façade pattern provides an interface which shields clients from complex
//functionality in one or more subsystems. It is a simple pattern that may seem trivial
//but it is powerful and extremely useful. It is often present in systems that are built
//around a multi-layer architecture.

//The intent of the Façade is to provide a high-level interface (properties and methods)
//that makes a subsystem or toolkit easy to use for the client.

//On the server, in a multi-layer web application you frequently have a presentation
//layer which is a client to a service layer. Communication between these two layers takes
//place via a well-defined API. This API, or façade, hides the complexities of the business
//objects and their interactions from the presentation layer.

//Another area where Façades are used is in refactoring. Suppose you have a confusing or
//messy set of legacy objects that the client should not be concerned about.
//You can hide this code behind a Façade. The Façade exposes only what is necessary and
//presents a cleaner and easy-to-use interface.

//Façades are frequently combined with other design patterns.
//Facades themselves are often implemented as singleton factories.
