//Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.
//Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

//The Decorator pattern extends (decorates) an object’s behavior dynamically.
//The ability to add new behavior at runtime is accomplished by a Decorator object which ‘wraps itself’
//around the original object. Multiple decorators can add or override functionality to the original object.

//An example of a decorator is security management where business objects are given additional access to
//privileged information depending on the privileges of the authenticated user.
//For example, an HR manager gets to work with an employee object that has appended (i.e. is decorated with)
//the employee's salary record so that salary information can be viewed.

//Decorators provide flexibility to statically typed languages by allowing runtime changes as opposed to
//inheritance which takes place at compile time. JavaScript, however, is a dynamic language and the ability
//to extend an object at runtime is baked into the language itself.
